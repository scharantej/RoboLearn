## **Design for a Flask Application - Robotics Learning Website**

### **HTML Files**

1. **index.html (Homepage):**
   - Serves as the main landing page of the website.
   - Contains an introductory message welcoming users to the Robotics learning website.
   - Provides links to other pages on the website, such as courses, tutorials, and resources.

2. **courses.html (Courses Page):**
   - Lists the available robotics courses offered on the website.
   - Each course display its title, description, length, and level (beginner, intermediate, advanced).
   - Includes a button or link to enroll in each course.

3. **tutorials.html (Tutorials Page):**
   - Displays a collection of robotics tutorials categorized by topic or difficulty level.
   - Each tutorial includes its title, a brief description, and a link to the actual tutorial content.

4. **resources.html (Resources Page):**
   - Lists various resources related to robotics, such as books, articles, videos, and online communities.
   - Each resource is presented with its title, a short description, and a link to the resource.

5. **contact.html (Contact Page):**
   - Provides users with a way to get in touch with the website administrators or instructors.
   - Includes a contact form, email address, or other preferred means of communication.

### **Routes**

1. **@app.route('/') (Homepage Route):**
   - Handles requests to the website's homepage URL ('/').
   - Corresponds to the 'index.html' file, which displays the introductory message and links to other pages.

2. **@app.route('/courses') (Courses Route):**
   - Responds to requests for the courses page URL ('/courses').
   - Renders the 'courses.html' file, which displays the list of available robotics courses.

3. **@app.route('/tutorials') (Tutorials Route):**
   - Handles requests to the tutorials page URL ('/tutorials').
   - Serves the 'tutorials.html' file, showing the collection of robotics tutorials.

4. **@app.route('/resources') (Resources Route):**
   - Processes requests for the resources page URL ('/resources').
   - Renders the 'resources.html' file, which displays the list of resources related to robotics.

5. **@app.route('/contact') (Contact Route):**
   - Handles requests to the contact page URL ('/contact').
   - Renders the 'contact.html' file, providing users with a contact form or other means of communication.


This design provides a basic structure for a Flask application that can serve as a platform for teaching Robotics in a structured and accessible manner.
